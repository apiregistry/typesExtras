# Annotations to capture extra semantics with RAML types

This repository contains my early experiments on extending RAML type system with annotations required for advanced client/server generation 
as well as for capturing additional semantics like skope bindings, crud, property inter dependencies, e.t.c

Main file with annotations is kept here: https://github.com/apiregistry/typesExtras/blob/master/typeExtras.raml

Current plans for this repository is to play with annotations for a bit and support them in codegen tools later.
